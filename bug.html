<p>This HTML contains an uncommon error: a nested <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag inside another <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag.  This is generally invalid HTML, although some browsers might render it without throwing an error. It can lead to unexpected form submission behavior and makes the code harder to maintain.
